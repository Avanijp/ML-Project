About the Project
The primary aim of a student performance indicators project is to enhance educational quality, support student success, and contribute to the overall improvement of the educational system. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains 1000 rows and 8 columns with various student attributes. 

Through exploratory data analysis, interesting patterns were discovered. Students who get Standard Lunch tend to perform better than students who got free/reduced lunch. Additionally The score of student whose parents possess master and bachelor level education are higher than others. Moreover Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers. Leveraging these valuable insights, the project seeks to create a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting student performance (test scores). This will empower educational institutions to implement targeted interventions, consequently improving student satisfaction and academic progress.
